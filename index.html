        A Portable Web Publication is a collection of content items (e.g.,
        pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with
        Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit.
        This document describes the use cases that inform the requirements
        for a Portable Web Publication, and should be read as part of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp/">Portable Web Publications for
        the Open Web Platform</a>.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The printed book has had hundreds of years of design refinement: we have developed and optimized page and book sizes and orientation, typesetting conventions, optimal margins and page layout. Readers in turn have grown used to the powerful affordances built into this information delivery technology: how we read books, use them, shelve them, own them, share them, and archive them.</p>

        <p>In parallel, the Web has developed with its own set of design principles and user-expectations: for ubiquity and speed of access and discovery, for the ease of linking information from one source to another, and for the simplicity of publishing anything, quickly.</p>

        <p>This Portable Web Publications Use Cases document is an effort by the W3C and the Digital Publishing Interest Group to articulate how these two design traditions work together to produce something more powerful, a fully accessible format which marries the bounded coherence of the printed book, with the open, networked spirit of the Web that can be used seamlessly online and offline.</p>

        <h1>Fundamental Features of a PWP</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Authors’ and readers’ requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>The publication should be readable in a browser</h3>
                    <p>Reading long form publications should not be restricted
                      to specific devices or applications but should be equally
                      available in a browser.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser
                          that he enjoys using for, e.g., annotation using his
                          own annotation server, or quickly copy and publish
                          extracts in a specialized social service. That means
                          that he wants to be able to read his textbook in this
                          environment, enjoying the environment he is familiar
                          with, rather than being forced in to a special
                          application for the purpose of that specific
                          publication</li>

                        <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large
                          datasets. The data can be presented interactively
                          through some very specialized data visualization
                          services relying on custom hardware on her computer.
                          These visualization services are incorporated into her
                          browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice
                          wants to make use of these wile reading her paper to
                          gain a better understanding of the content.</li>

                    <h3>The publication should conform to all the requirements of horizontal dependencies</h3>

                    <p>Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device independence, security, or privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal” dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
                    </p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>(Web) Accessibility:</dt>
                        <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access the content, i.e., they should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.</dd>
                        <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>
                        <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little user intervention.</dd>
                        <dt>Security:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should prevent malicious attacks, data theft, etc., even if they contain secure mashups, access to distributed services, etc. Consuming the content should not jeopardize the integrity of the underlying data, users’ privacy, or machine operations.</dd>
                        <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should maintain and support the user’s privacy, in spite of the fact that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data, as well as the ability to ubiquitously track the users' online activity.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies <em>must empower the authors</em> (writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.</p>

                    <p>All these constraints are usually formalized in the context of the usage on the Web, but they are also valid for publications in general <em>regardless of whether they are online or offline, or whether the publication is distributed as a single unit or not</em>. Actually, in some cases, for example due to legislative reasons, the demands on digital publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Asmait uses a dedicated braille e-reader capable of using standard Open Web technologies, that can render any WCAG-compliant content. She needs to be able to read her newspaper and contribute to the interactive discussion components on her dedicated braille reader, not just a standard browser and computer combination.</li>

                        <li>Legal Publishing Ltd. publishes all the official texts, as issued by the government of its country. Per local legislation, the publication MUST be accessible, following W3C’s WCAG Level AA requirements, to serve as official references in courts.</li>

                        <li>EducationPublishing Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also include access to interactive tests via specialized services on the Web that regularly access the student’s progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s test data must be preserved (whether they are embedded in the publication or online). This, and the fact that digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that EducationPublishing is liable in case they are not fulfilled.</li>

                        <li>PublicationInternational SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in many languages. In order to continue its business in, e.g., Japan, it must be able to produce digital publications with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is the only way those publications are accepted by local customers.</li>

                        <li>Vera has several devices she uses to read her books, depending on where she is. She may use her table with a larger screen when sitting in an armchair at home, she uses her phone when commuting to her work by train, and uses her laptop when adding more complex annotations to the book. The book is authored in a way that, while maintaing the integrity of data like bookmarks and annotations, the book is automatically adapted to a different screen size, or to the fact that her phone does not have a keyboard.</li>

                        <li>BigAirline uses digital versions of the airline manuals. This means that the manuals are put “online” to keep them up-to-date, and the pilots have access to the latest version even when they are flying, i.e., they are off line. The way the manuals are authors and managed ensures that the integrity of the manuals and the relevant data is maintained at all times, to secure that the pilots operate based on correct information only.</li>

                    <h3>PWPs should be able to make use of all facilities
                      offered by the Open Web Platform</h3>

                    <p>There is a formidable development of visualization systems,
                      interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are
                      built on top of the Open Web Platform, including accessing
                      external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have
                      been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide
                      possibilities that traditional publications (books,
                      magazines, scholarly papers, educational materials, etc.)
                      should also benefit from. That requires publications to
                      become first class citizens on the Web platforms. </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>For scholarly publishing, Web-only publications
                          gradually become part of the mainstream (e.g., the
                          multidisciplinary
                          <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the
                          new
                          <a href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ
                            CompSci</a> journals) with the main content being
                            published using traditional Web technologies like
                            HTML and CSS. These publications increasingly use
                            additional media such as video, audio, animated
                            graphics, or very large images, and the trend is
                            to consider these as integral parts of the
                            scientific output. (
                            <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
                              Bostock’s recent article on visualizing
                              algorithms</a> or the “live” presentation of data
                              in a <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v2">
                                paper published by F1000 Research</a> are good
                                examples for the new possibilities.) This means
                                the publications need access to the latest
                                visualization, data management, etc, tools that
                                the Open Web Platform based tools can offer.</li>

                        <li>Educational materials are increasingly making use
                          of Open Web Platform facilities. They include
                          runnable program snippets, interactive testing tools
                          (linked to online evaluation facilities); in many
                          respect, the borderline between these publications
                          and Web Applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                        <li id="in_house_doc">A special form of document are
                          “in-house” documents, whose production is related to
                          technical and/or user documentation of complex
                          products as well as complex administrative documents.
                          The sheer quantity and complexity of production, as
                          well as confidentiality requirements, mean that the
                          production are done in-house. In many respects major
                          corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
                          or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO,
                          or the UNESCO have become specialized publishers
                          themselves. The quantity of documentation makes it
                          infeasible to produce these documents in print (or
                          print-only); instead, publishing them on the public
                          Web, an Intranet, and/or providing them through
                          specialized mobile devices is the viable alternative.
                          The production of these documents has similar
                          challenges to scholarly publications like
                          accessibility issues, portability of annotations, or
                          the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

                    <h3>It should be possible to see the publication in a
                      “paginated” view</h3>

                    <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on
                      the Web in Web browsers, publications must provide the
                      possibility to switch to a paginated view if the user so
                      desires or as the author suggests. Pagination may
                      automatically adapt page sizes to the device’s or the
                      browser’s viewport, and may contain separate headers,
                      footers, possibly page numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is separate from the need to retain original page
                      numbering (often from the print edition) which must be
                      available on demand.
                    </p>

                    <p>For more detailed requirements on pagination, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Pagination_Requirements">here</a>.</p>

                          over 1200 pages. For usability reasons (e.g., to give
                          her a better sense of where she “is” within the book,
                          to give her a bounded view of a portion of the text
                          that would help her navigate) she decides to switch her
                          reading environment to paged view to enjoy the novel.</li>

                          defined as a standalone unit that would be a single
                          page when printed, with a timeline with the main
                          events in the footer area of the page.</li>

                          view of content that extends across multiple html documents.</li>
                        <li>A publisher wants to provide transition effects between pages, both within and across content documents.</li>
                        <li>A classroom teacher says, “turn to page 137 of your
                          textbook.” Regardless of layout and font size, students
                          reading digital editions need to find the same location
                          in the textbook as one another, and as students reading

                      a (possibly large) number of Web Resources, like HTML,
                      SVG, or CSS, and it may also contain data files, or
                      executable resources like JavaScript, iPython scripts, or
                      Java. This reflects the current practice on the Web,
                      emphasizing the need of memory requirement on small
                      devices, cacheability, or independent development.</p>

                          resources as a unit to include it into its business
                          workflow. </li>

                          HTML file. Parsing through one 1200-page HTML document
                          is difficult and resource-intensive. Parsing through a
                          package of 60 HTML documents, roughly 20 pages each,

                          root element styles must be preserved.</li>

                      This way, when changing the state of a PWP from, e.g., online to
                      offline, an implementation knows which PWP
                      resources are essential for the display of the content, and
                      therefore must be included in the offline version, or which

                        During offline or low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable - mainly the text (and possibly images).
                        Having a reasonable fallback for video (a poster image or placeholder image) would allow Nick to read the content while offline or in limited storage.

                    components of a PWP to the user. A PWP will likely be

                    within the resources (i.e., parsing them in advance to extract

            <p>
                During the consumption of a publication, a user may change their online/offline state in many ways.
                For example, they may start reading on an internet enabled PC, move to an internet-enabled portable device, which may enter offline-mode at some point, and then finish up on another PC.

                    It’s possible that certain items will be dynamic, requiring the use of an external resource (or server) to provide the data.
                    In offline mode, the user may want to be alerted that content could not be obtained, or be shown some fallback set of data.
                    In this case, being able to specify an explicit "no-connectivity" or "offline-mode" alternative would allow the publication author to have more control over the user's experience and replace a potential error-display with a limited subset of a good experience.

  <h1>Distribution, Sharing and External Resources</h1>

  <section>
   <h2>The distribution of a PWP should not affect its versioning</h2>
    <p>Simply distributing or sharing a PWP to multiple destinations and devices should not result in multiple versions of the PWP.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Publisher Corp. Inc. publishes a new PWP and sends it to its distributors and customers. This PWP is downloaded to devices, or synced across several devices, or made available to a customer-specific cloud. Customers can access this file from different retailers, through different applications, either directly or downloaded from a private cloud. Thus, the PWP is duplicated many times, resulting in a huge number of items. There is one source manifestation, therefore one canonical identifier for a large number of items spread across devices and buyers. Those items should not be different versions of the source PWP unless they contain modifications that make them different PWPs.</li>
      <li>Mary creates a PWP and sends it to Dave and Kristin, who each send it to two friends, who then send it on to their friends. Ultimately there are many copies of Mary's PWP but they are not different versions unless they have been altered; one shall say that they are all “the same” PWP.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The distribution of PWPs should conform to the standard processes and expectations of commercial publishing channels.</h2>
    <ul class="use-cases">
       <li>Ahmed acquires a PWP on an e-commerce platform. He expects to be able to receive the PWP as a file (rather than only having access to it) and to be able to load it onto its different reading  devices.</li>
       <li>Bridget buys (rather than subscribes to) a PWP. She expects to have permanent access to that PWP and to be able to make reasonable use of it.</li>
       <li>Alice acquires a PWP through a subscription service and downloads it. When, later on, she decides to unsubscribe from the service, this PWP becomes unavailable to her.</li>
       <li>Bill acquires a PWP through a rental service. After a certain period, this PWP becomes unavailable to him.</li>
       <li>Slicendice Publishing publishes many PWPs, some of which are different versions or subsets or combinations of others. Slicendice needs not only to be able to uniquely identify each unique PWP but also to identify each "copy" or "delivery" ("item") of each of those PWPs so that it can track "what" has been sold and "how many" of each one have been sold.</li>
       <li>Cobble-It Publishing creates PWPs from a mix of internal content and content licensed from other parties. Using PWP metadata, Cobble-It is able to keep track of the rights associated with the different components so that it can realize income from its own IP and appropriately compensate the parties whose IP it has licensed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>PWPs should support cross-references that can be resolved locally or externally.</h2>
    <p>A user should have an option to access their local copy of a PWP when there is a choice between a local copy and an external source.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
     <li>Writer Annie writes a dissertation. She references her Master's thesis, which is published on the university website. Her colleague Bob has read her Master's thesis before and has annotated his copy. When he clicks the reference in Annie's dissertation, he gets redirected to his local copy of Annie's Master's thesis. Her friend, Charlie, hasn't read her Master's thesis before. Charlie needs to be online when clicking the reference in order to access Annie's Master's thesis on the university website.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Several PWPs may share external resources.</h2>
    <p>In order to make serial publications lighter and speed up processing, PWP should support the injection of external resources.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>EsteemedPublisher creates a software application to distribute daily journals to readers. These journals share script libraries, CSS files, images and other resources, that are downloaded once in a while by the reading application and cached.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>PWPs should be able to access external data.</h2>
    <p>Requirement 2.1.13 states that “There should be a way to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources”; essential resources must be included in the offline version; non-essential resources may be either included also, or accessed online when possible. It is up to the packaging software to decide which resources will be included, and which won’t.</p>
    <p>This requirement adds the possibility to specify that some data must stay external to the packaged publication.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Rosa has submitted an article to EsteemedJournal and provided her research data in CSV format. She and EsteemedJournal wish to provide users access to the CSVs when accessing her article, but they decide to inactivate the inclusion of the research data in the packaged publication. Albert reads Rosa’s article from a packaged version. When online, he can access the research data, but when offline, he cannot access it and its reading system fails gracefully.</li>
      <li>Risha publishes an article which includes an interactive component relying on a database access, exposed to the Web as a REST API. The interactive component is implemented as a Javascript library. Such data cannot be included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is of no use without such data. Risha therefore marks the PWP component relative to the interactive module as “not packageable”. Albert reads Risha’s article from a packaged version. When online, he can access the interactive module, but when offline, he cannot access it and its reading system fails gracefully.</li>
      <li>InteractiveCompany publishes a PWP containing an interactive component implemented as a Javascript library, but this library requires several other JS libraries. The interactive component has not been marked as “not packageable”. The reading system therefore packages all JS libraries required to get the interactive component running offline, with a recursive inspection of the JS code.</li>

      <h2>Manifests should include the technical and descriptive metadata and basic characteristics of the constituent resources</h2>

      <p>A user agent requires information about the package and its components in order to process it. E.g., performance and memory requirements may prevent a user agent from parsing a large number of content documents in order to discover the necessary components and their relationships. A user agent may need to make some decisions about how to present content before displaying it.</p>

      <p>Some necessary features are listed among the fundamental features of a PWP (see <a href="#find-information"></a>); the use cases below provide a (non-exhaustive) list of further information.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>A user agent may not be able to process files beyond a certain size due to bandwidth, storage or memory limitations, or processing time expectations. Hence this information should be available in advance.</li>

        <li>A user agent should be able to process permissions and rights information for each component identified in the package. For example, it need to know whether it has the rights to place an image of the Mona Lisa owned by the Louvre in a package to be downloaded offline.</li>

        <li>A user agent should be able to determine if captions are available for multimedia resources within the publication.</li>

        <li>For further processing the user agent needs to have access to additional information including:
            <ul>
                <li>the accessibility of each component;</li>
                <li>whether it needs additional processing instructions, such as with MathML;</li>
                <li>the title, author(s), cover image, etc., to display the publication on a shelf without downloading all its content;</li>
                <li>whether the content is unaltered;</li>
                <li>the origin of the publication.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The manifest should provide access to the general metadata of a publication</h2>
        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>The manifest may be a "first point of entry" for the user agent when getting hold of a publication, and should therefore provide an easy way to get hold of the general descriptive publication metadata (e.g., author’s and publisher’s data, library data, copyright information, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should make it possible to provide a streamlined access to disjoint parts of the publication</h2>

      <p>It should be possible for the author to convey several reading orders for the content of the publication, that may go beyond the “default” <a href="reading-order">reading order</a>. Furthermore, this alternative reading order may not necessary include the full content of the publication but only specific parts thereof.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>EsteemedJournalPublisher would like to offer the users of the EsteemedJournal of Chemistry App the opportunity to read only the abstracts of the journals in the app. The App Package must offer the user a list (table of contents) of abstracts (disjoint objects in the package with semantic information or metadata informing the package of the nature of the object). </li>

          <li>The publisher wants to provide “teasers” for a book by providing a series of extracts that are meant to give an overview of the book without the necessity to read the whole publication. This can be typically used by a reseller allowing for a prospective client to access part of the publication free of charge.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should include information of new content</h2>

      <p>The manifest should include information that makes it possible for a user agent to find out whether a specific content has changed since a last access or not. This may or may not directly reflect versioning, as referred to in the requirement on versioning (see <a href="#versioning"></a>), insofar as the granularity may be different.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>Shoshana is an organic chemist. She has purchased the Esteemed Journal of Chemistry App. She downloads Organic Chem Quarterly in her lab and reads the first article over lunch. Shoshana begins the book reviews during office hours but must tend to her students' questions, so she closes the app. Shoshana opens the app on the train ride home to resume reading the book reviews. She is happy to find that the app opens to the exact location and opens quickly because most of the material does not need to be downloaded a second time. </li>

          <li>An archival service needs to update an Archival Information Package (i.e., a previously harvested PWP) because a new version of a component of the PWP has been published</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should include means to use links to resources, regardless of location</h2>

      <p>The fundamental requirement on identification already states that there should be a way to uniquely identify a publication (see <a href="#unique-identifier"></a>). This requirement should be extended to resources <em>within</em> a publication, e.g., a chapter, an image, a mathematical formula. To achieve these, the manifest should contain the necessary information to make the mapping of URI-s possible.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>A scholarly mathematical publication refers to a specific theorem in another publication, and that reference must be unique, stable and retrievable on the Web. That reference should not depend on whether the publishes issues a new version of the target publication (thereby possibly change the section numbering) or whether the publication is available now for offline use.</li>

          <li>An archival service wants to harvest (spider) a PWP, and expects to find in the manifest what it will need to make sure it gets all the pieces of the PWP that need to be archived, even if on separate servers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="alternative-reading-order">
        <h2>Manifest may include alternative reading orders</h2>

        <p>Whilst one of the fundamental requirements is that the default reading order should be made available to the user agent (see <a href="#reading-order"></a>), the manifest should also provide means to define alternative reading orders. It is up to the user agent how this alternative reading order is conveyed to the reader (via some suitable user interface techniques).</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>EducationalPublisher publishes a complex textbook. The textbook is created is such a way that it could be used both for beginner and advanced level. The default reading order corresponds to beginners, but the goal is that advanced students can follow a different path through the material, corresponding to their level of knowledge. EducationPublisher adds, therefore, alternative reading orders to the publication that advanced users can follow</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="flexible-access-manifest">
        <h2>There should be flexible ways to get hold of the manifest for a publication</h2>

        <p>The physical realization of the manifest may be a file in some predefined format (XML, JSON, etc.). There may be several ways to get hold of that manifest (file on a well known location, usage of an HTML <code>link</code> element, etc). PWP should provide a high level of flexibility, i.e., possible alternatives, on how that manifest should be found.
        </p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li id="bigretailer-manifest">BigRetailer receives a publication from EsteemedPublisher that it intends to add to its catalogue. BigRetailer wants to change or extend some general information (typically contained in the manifest) regarding the publication, like the local bibliographic metadata, or its own “teaser” in terms an alternative reading order (see <a href="#alternative-reading-order"></a>). To achieve that, BigRetailer provides its own version of the publication manifest, and makes it sure that the user agent takes that one as the publication’s manifest (e.g., by providing a reference to the alternative manifest via an HTTP <code>LINK</code> header).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>There should be a possibility to combine manifests from several origins</h2>

        <p>The default approach for a user agent is to get hold of the manifest (file) as one unit via some flexible means (see <a href="#flexible-access-manifest"></a>). However, an even more flexible means is to provide possibilities to provide <em>several</em> manifests file that the user agen would combine, following some rules, to yield the final, overall manifest for the publication.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            It is recognized that the proper definition/implementation of this requirement may lead to major technical complications and, therefore may not be fulfilled.
        </p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>The simple solution for the <a href="#bigretailer-manifest">use case involving BigRetailer</a> requires the creation of a <em>complete</em> manifest, involving duplicating the information provided the EsteemedPublisher. This is obviously error prone if the publication’s manifest is large. If it was possible to combine manifests, BitRetailer can only provide its own additional (and possibly replacement) information and let the user agent combine the manifests of BigRetailer and of EsteemedPublisher to yield the final manifest.</li>

  <h1>Archiving</h1>
  <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. PWP offers this potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The locations of all PWP components should be discoverable</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn where all of the components that constitute a PWP are located in order to be able to archive it. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics for packaging collections of interlinked resources into discrete publications, making archiving more expensive and error-prone.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
	  <li>An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of a book. They are able to locate all of the images, markup, scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object. The archiving service retrieves these Resources and package them into a logical archival unit for ingest into a preservation repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to discover that a new version of one or more PWP components have been published</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that a new version of one or more PWP components have been published (i.e., at the same locations as previously) in order to be able to archive them. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to periodically re-download and re-checksum all PWP components to determine whether any updates have transpired, unnecessarily increasing the load on archiving service and publisher servers and delaying updated PWP components from being archived.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it has already archived. One such poll indicates that several Resources that constitute the object have changed. The archiving service retrieves these Resources and store them as incremental updates to the appropriate archival unit in a preservation repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to discover that one or more new components have been added to a PWP</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more PWP components have been added to a PWP in order to be able to archive them. Without such a mechanism, there is a possibility that the archiving service will not know that the new component belongs to the PWP, because the publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics have not been updated.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it has already archived. One such poll indicates that several Resources have been added to the object. The archiving service retrieves these Resources and store them as incremental updates to the appropriate archival unit in a preservation repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to discover that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP in order to be able to propagate this change to the archive. Without such a mechanism, there is a possibility that the archiving service will mistakenly make PWP components accessible that should not be.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>A publisher issues a retraction for a published article, resulting in the addition of new Resources to the object (i.e., the retraction notice) and the removal of others (i.e., the article content). An archiving service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already archived, and discovers the retraction. The archiving service retrieves the new Resources and record those that are no longer accessible, carrying over the cumulative updates to a preservation repository.</li>
      <li>A copyright dispute results in the takedown of a published book. An archiving service regularly polls for changes to this book, which it has already archived, and discovers that it has been taken down. It records that the Resources that constitute the object are no longer accessible and propagates this update to a preservation repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to indicate whether one or more PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to determine which, if any, PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics for locating or parsing out descriptive metadata, making archiving more expensive and decreasing the reliability of reporting.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of an article. Along with the images, markup, scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object, it is able to locate a file containing descriptive metadata. The archiving service retrieves these resources and packages them into a logical archival unit for ingest into a preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses the descriptive metadata structure and saves its contents into an associated management database.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Accessibility</h1>

    <p>Some fundamental use cases and requirements already imply the usage of accessibility, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#personalized"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#single-package"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <section>
    <h2>Accessible Metadata</h2>
    <p> Accessibility of a PWP as a whole must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a PWP is accessible. See also <a href="#technical-metadata"></a></p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li> Accessibility of a PWP must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a PWP is accessible</li>
        <li>Ferdous wants to buy a book about a museum exhibit and wants to guarantee before he does that his screen reader will describe the images to him in great detail.</li>
        <li>Alejandra must ensure that the equation editors in her textbook have non-mouse functionality before she purchases the textbook.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Granular Accessibility of a PWP must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a specific chapter or element within a PWP is accessible</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Jessie is taking a class and the professor has assigned Chapter 5 in an art textbook for review, but before Jessie puchases the book she wants to ensure that Chapter 5 is accessible.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Adding Alternative Media</h2>
    <p>A PWP must support the ability to include multiple renditions of a publication.  Within their publication in additon to the print rendition a publisher may include a fully narrated rendition, or a video with described audio and captioning.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher of accessible content, I need to add content such as a braille style sheet, image descriptions, or video captioning (text / descriptive audio) to a PWP previously published by a third party.</li>
        <li>Frank has dyslexia and finds reading printed books a very frustrating experience.  Having a book read to him with synchronized highlighting of the text not only allows him to comprehend the book but helps him become a better reader.</li>
        <li>Julia has ADHD and is frequently be distracted when trying to read. Her teachers' determined she is a visual learner and scores better when the material is presented in video format. </li>
        <li>Jacob has poor depth perception and is more of a tactile learner, he has a difficult time conceptualizing three dimensional objects.  Having an embedded 3D image available to be printed alongside the visual image will greatly improve his understanding of the object being presented.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>

   <section>
     <h2>Braille</h2>
       <p>There is an important difference between just sending the raw text to a braille display which will translate the text to the default braille grade and language the braille display is using and having a pre-formatted braille rendition using a specific braille table.</p>
     <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher wanting to fulfill my legal requirements in creating an accessible Math textbook, to this end the inclusion of math equation examples in both Braille as well as MathML is desired since not all reading systems fully support MathML.  Nemeth Braille is primarily used and has therefore been added as a separate preformatted Nemeth Braille examples to my publication in addition to the MathML.</li>

         <li>Alberto who has been blind since birth is studying to become an engineer.  Some of his advance textbooks would greatly benefit from a pre-formatted fully transcribed braille rendition with braille codes or complex formatting which is not yet well supported by the software typically available.</li>

         <li>James a struggling blind artist requires that the musical score within this publication be rendered in braille music.  James uses freely available assistive technology which does not have braille music translations built in and would need this already converted into braille music notation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

   <section>
     <h2>Building a Custom PWP</h2>
       <p>A PWP needs to support the ability to construct a limited package with only a subset of the necessary content.</p>
     <ul class="use-cases">
       <li>Buffy is Deafblind. Every morning she downloads her daily newspaper. Like most news sites, it provides many rich multimedia presentations. As a high-quality, accessible news site, it's multimedia presentations come with captions and transcripts. Buffy does not want to waste her data plan on the useless-to-her audio and video content. She'd like to build a PWP which contains the captions and transcripts, but not the data-heavy videos.</li>
       <li>Smitha has limited hand mobility, and controls her e-reader by voice. She subscribes to her monthly comics online. The comics contain interactive dialogue sections where, instead of advancing pages the a more conventional method, readers click-and-drag the panels around the page. The fallback method to make this accessible is the more conventional page-turning method. Smitha wants to download her monthly comics in the smaller fallback format, rather than download the to-her unusable packages which she is then required to individually reconfigure.</li>
        <li>See also <a href="#distribute-uniquely"></a>.</li>
     </ul>
   </section>


   <section>
       <h2>Package needs to support time-based media and text </h2>
         <p>A PWP needs to support time-based media, such as synchronized
           video, audio, captions or transcript, or sign language interpretation.
           A PWP must enable synced media experience to the user
           while navigating through the book with sufficient level
           of granularity without constant connectivity.</p>

       <ul class="use-cases">
           <li>Illyés has a cognitive disability and uses accomodated texts in
             the classroom, to help  learn the content while improving his reading.
             His assistive technology uses combined audio and text, turning the page
             for him while reading along in sync with the page currently open.</li>
          <li>Bogi has auditory processing disorder. They are reading an annotated screenplay showing
            the author's original notes, along with synchronized video clips.
            Bogi needs to be able to view the captions on the video clips, even
            though they're associated with snippets of the screenplay.</li>
